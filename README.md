# UCD_CodeClub https://ucdcodeclub.github.io
The UCD CodeClub is a peer-led support group for computational biologists. We host interactive and friendly meetings to tackle and troubleshoot coding problems for big data analysis. Our current format is to discuss the book R for Data Science (http://r4ds.had.co.nz) and practice together the examples given.

Our meetings are hosted at University College Dublin, Veterinary Sciences Centre.

Check out our Wiki on Reproducible Research (go to the Wiki tab, then Reproducible Research page).
