# UCD_CodeClub
The UCD CodeClub is a peer-led support group for computational biologists. We host interactive and friendly meetings to tackle and troubleshoot coding problems for big data analysis. Our current format is to discuss the book R for Data Science (http://r4ds.had.co.nz) and practice together the examples given.

Our meetings are hosted at University College Dublin, Veterinary Sciences Centre.

Check out our Wiki on Reproducible Research (go to the Wiki tab> then Reproducible Researchpage).
Going to add resources and advice to this page relevant to managing and carrying out your analyses so they can be shared and replicated effectively.
