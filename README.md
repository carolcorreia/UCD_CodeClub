# UCD_CodeClub
The UCD CodeClub is a peer-led support group for computational biologists. We host interactive and friendly meetings to tackle and troubleshoot coding problems for big data analysis. Our current format is to discuss the book R for Data Science (http://r4ds.had.co.nz) and practice together the examples given.
