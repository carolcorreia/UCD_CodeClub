# 3.3 ####
#Mapping an aesthetic to ggplot, color here: 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
#Can also use shape and size, or transparency (alpha) 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))
#last point is missing cause there is only 6 shapes in the plot because: 
#1: The shape palette can deal with a maximum of 6 discrete values because more than 6
#becomes difficult to discriminate; you have 7. Consider specifying shapes manually if you
# must have them. 

#Make all your points a specific color - in geom_point, outside aes() : 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")

# 3.3 EXERCISES #####
# 1. Why are the points not blue? 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
# Its because the color specification is inside the aes() function 
# I can specify a class to have color here, if I want to specify a color, its outside the bracket

# 2. Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are continuous? 
# (Hint: type ?mpg to read the documentation for the dataset). 
# How can you see this information when you run mpg? 
typeof(colnames(mpg))
?mpg
colnames(mpg)
lapply(mpg, typeof)
lapply(mpg, class)
mpg 
# Because its a tibble you dont need to use head, it will always give you a header and classes of your columns 
# For a data frame you need to use head()
#all integer column types are probably continuous? 

?lapply #returns a list 
#types of vectors 
# integer 1, 2, 3, 
# double 0.22, 0.33, 0.3 - numbers with decimals 
# character - words 
# Whats an atomic vector??? Google it 

# 3. Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. 
# How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables? 

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = year))
# color is a range 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = year)) 
# This gave me a range of sizes even though there is only 2 years!!!! 
# huge sizes and small ones, year is a legend 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = year))
# Error: A continuous variable can not be mapped to shape 

# 4. What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics? 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class, size = class))
# It just does it 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class, alpha = class))
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = year, alpha = year))

# 5. What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point) 
?geom_point
# For shapes that have a border (like 21), you can colour the inside and
# outside separately. Use the stroke aesthetic to modify the width of the
# border
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "black", fill = "white", size = 5, stroke = 5)

# 6. What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, 
# like aes(colour = displ < 5)? 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ < 5))
# It makes a legend with false and true and splits the colors where display (x axis) is <5 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = year < 2002))
# That one looks very cool 

# 3.5 ####
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
# facet_wrap makes multiple plots per class - this will be useful for my HPIs and potentially PCAs? 
?facet_wrap

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
# This gives one variable levels on top and one on right, and then x y plots 

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
# this one looks odd??? it gives you cyl on top and doesnt create rows and columns, just columns 

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(cyl ~ .)
# This one does just rows 

# 3.5 EXERCISES ####
# 1. What happens if you facet on a continuous variable? 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap( ~ year) 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ , nrow = 2) 
mpg 
# It did the first one and the last one.... but the plots look the same? 
unique(mpg$year) 
# 1999 2008 
# There is only 2 years!!!! 
length(unique(mpg$year)) # This tells you how many unique things in a vector 
# So the answer is - if you facet a continuous variable it will give you a lot of answers ? 

# 2. What do the empty cells in plot with facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) mean? How do they relate to this plot? 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) 

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl)) 
# This second one says less, apart from the fact that between 4 and r there is nothing

# 3. What plots does the following code make? What does . do? 
# I already found this - . gets rid of columns or rows 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(year ~ .) 

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl) 

# 4. Take the first faceted plot in this section: 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2) 

# What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? 
# How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset? 

# Answer --- 
# Faceting splits the data per group instead of giving it a colour. It is easier 
# to distinguish the specific points that are in each group. 
# The colour option would be better in a global approach though - to compare them to each other. 
# I would use faceting only for distinctly separate datasets - for instance, PCA plots at seperate times post infection 

# 5. Read ?facet_wrap. 
# What does nrow do? What does ncol do? 
# What other options control the layout of the individual panels? 
# Ans --- loads (scales, space for size of panels, shrink)
# Why doesnâ€™t facet_grid() have nrow and ncol arguments? 
# Ans -- Because the number of rows and columns are defined by the amount of factors in the variables you choose for the grid. 
?facet_wrap 
?facet_grid

# 6. When using facet_grid() you should usually put the variable 
# with more unique levels in the columns. Why? 

# YEAH, WHY? Fit to page?
